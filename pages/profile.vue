    <TextWithTitle title="Overview">
      Heavily influenced by the DIY punk rock and skate scenes I started
      designing t-shirts and posters for bands after school and throughout
      college. I started getting into screen-printing and collecting work from
      my favourite artists & illustrators. I graduated University in 2012 with a
      BA in graphic design and after a short time working as a print technician,
      I started at a busy design studio in Finnieston. I now work with wonderful
      people at Walnut Wasp creative agency designing brands and building
      websites for the food and beverage industry. I love traditional printing
      and in addition to working in a digital print studio, I have also
      completed screen-printing courses at Glasgow Print Studio and risograph
      workshops at Risotto Studios in Glasgow. However Iâ€™m also interested in
      digital / web design and I am a self taught front-end developer.
