    brief:
      'Nick Bruce & his band are a six-piece funk/soul function and wedding band. They came to me looking for a rebrand to tie in with their new public funk soul dinner dance events in an old 50’s Motown style. They wanted the brand to feel a bit more modern, and not necessarily multicoloured and as primitive as some of the posters of the time. The challenge was to create a brand that drew inspiration from traditional 50’s design while updating it for Nick’s modern band.',
